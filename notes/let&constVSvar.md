# let & const vs var

- var is function scoped whereas let & const are block scoped.
- If a variable is used before its declared, and using let or const, then strict mode throws an reference error. Because variables declared with let or const canâ€™t be used before its declared. Its called TDZ(Temporal Dead Zone)


```js
    function saySomething() {
      var greeting = 'Hello'
      {
        greeting = 'New Hello' // Reference error, can't access greeting before initialization
        let greeting = 'Modern greeting'
      }
    }
    saySomething()
```

- Whenever var is outside any function scope, then its value is created on global scope i.e. `window` object.

```js
    var a = 21
    console.log(window.a) //21

```
- Every loop is a new scope instance. Everytime execution enters a scope, everything resets. `value` is created new in every exceution.
```js
var keepGoing = true;
while (keepGoing) {
    let value = Math.random();
    if (value > 0.5) {
        keepGoing = false;
    }
}
```
