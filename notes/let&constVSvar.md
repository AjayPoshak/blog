# let & const vs var

- var is function scoped whereas let & const are block scoped.
- If a variable is used before its declared, and using let or const, then strict mode throws an reference error. Because variables declared with let or const canâ€™t be used before its declared. Its called TDZ(Temporal Dead Zone)


```js
    function saySomething() {
      var greeting = 'Hello'
      {
        greeting = 'New Hello' // Reference error, can't access greeting before initialization
        let greeting = 'Modern greeting'
      }
    }
    saySomething()
```

Temporal means the time, not position. Consider the below example

```js
askQuestion()
let sName = "Ajay"
function askQuestion() {
    console.log('Yayy ', sName) // ReferenceError: can't access sName before initialization
}
```
So position wise `askQuestion` comes after the `sName` declaration, but `askQuestion` is invoked before the `sName` has been declared.

let & const are auto-registered at the top of scope, but not initialized. As shown below
```
var sName = 'Vijay'
{
    console.log(sName) // Throws Reference error: can't access sName before initialization
    ...
    ...
    let sName = 'Yash'
}
```

- Whenever var is outside any function scope, then its value is created on global scope i.e. `window` object.

```js
    var a = 21
    console.log(window.a) //21

```

## Loops

- Every loop is a new scope instance. Everytime execution enters a scope, everything resets. `value` is created new in every exceution.
```js
var keepGoing = true;
while (keepGoing) {
    let value = Math.random();
    if (value > 0.5) {
        keepGoing = false;
    }
}
```
- If we have a looping variable, Is that variable created new in every iteration?

```
for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    let value = i * 10;
    console.log(`${ i }: ${ value }`);
}
```
Is `i` created new everytime, like variable `value`?
Answer is yes. That part is also included in loop body.
It could be viewed like this
```js
let $$i = 0
for(/* nothing here */; $$i < 3; $$i++) {
    let i = $$i
    let value = i * 10
    ....
    ....
}
```
What about the `const`? Why below snippet does not work then?
```js
for (const i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    let value = i * 10;
    console.log(`${ i }: ${ value }`);
}
```
Lets expand reuse our previous mental model again

```js
const $$i = 0
for (/*nothing here*/; $$i < 3; $$i++) {
    const i = $$i     // Reassignment won't work, OOPS!!!
    let value = i * 10;
    console.log(`${ i }: ${ value }`);
}

```
